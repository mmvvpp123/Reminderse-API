          <u>Verification process</u>
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
          determine you are the same person about whom we have the information
          in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to
          provide information so that we can match it with the information you
          have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of
          request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so
          that we can match the information you provide with the information we
          already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication
          method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously provided to us.
          We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances
          dictate.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will only use personal information provided in your request to
          verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent
          possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for
          the purposes of verification. If, however, if we cannot verify your
          identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request
          that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying
          your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will
          delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish
          verifying you.
